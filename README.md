# Chord-P2P-System-and-Simulation
The goal of this project is to implement Scala using the actor model the Chord protocol and a simple object access service to prove its usefulness. The specification of the Chord protocol can be found in the paperChord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applicationsby  Ion  Stoica,  Robert  Morris,  David  Karger,  M.  Frans  Kaashoek,  Hari  Balakrishnan. https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf (Links to an external site.).  You can also refer to the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord(peer-to-peer) (Links to an external site.) The paper above, in section 2.3 contains a specification of the Chord API and of the API to be implemented by the application.
